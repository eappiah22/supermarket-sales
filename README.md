This Python script provides essential data visualization techniques to explore datasets using Matplotlib, Pandas, and NumPy. It contains three main functions thus one to generate distribution graphs for columns with a specified range of unique values, another to display a correlation matrix for numerical columns, and a third to create scatter and density(KDE) plots for visualizing pairwise relationships between variables. These visualizations are useful for getting an overview of the datasetâ€™s structure and variable relationships.
The plot per-column distribution function creates histograms for numerical data and bar charts for categorical data, showing the distribution of each column. The plot correlation matrix generates a heatmap to visualize correlations between numerical columns, helping identify strong relationships between variables. Finally, the plot scatter matrix function plots scatter matrices and kernel density estimates (KDE) to display distributions and correlations, annotating the scatter plots with correlation coefficients for clarity.
To utilize this script, you must first load your dataset into Pandas DataFrame, and then call the appropriate visualization functions. The script is flexible, allowing you to adjust the number of graphs, plot sizes, and text annotations to suit your dataset.
